Programmers.SE has a blog, though it is one that is awkward to maintain
keep interest - apparently moderately labor intensive on the part of the
editors and authors.

This is another attempt at a blog. Not so much about capturing things
from the *site*, but rather the chat room - The Whiteboard.

Frequently, there is some bit of knowledge and information that gets out
and people want to preserve. It might be a rant, it might be a "that is
a neat idea", or it might be a big block of advice.  Whichever way it goes,
it is good to try to save and refine that bit of information in way
that is more accessible.

After seeing some inspiration from [room 15](http://room-15.github.io/blog/)
(the Android chat room from Stack Overflow), this got enough of umpf to
finally be written.
