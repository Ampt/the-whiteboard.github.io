# Five books

If you are old enough to remember book stores, you would walk past the
computer book shelve (or if you were lucky, shelves, or the *extremely*
fortunate would find an entire section of the book store dedicated to
computers and technology).

Now, those books aren't quite as accessible. It is harder to wander down
the aisle and thumb through a book to see if its worth while. While there
are online bookstores and temporary loans, that just doesn't have the
same accessibility of "open to a random page and see if it looks useful."

Thus, people often ask the classic question of "what do you recommend
reading?"

## [A Pattern Language](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195019199/)

The first thing that will come to mind when seeing that title is "ug,
another book on patterns." Or maybe "I thought it was named *Design Patterns -
Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*"

This isn't anything like that book. Or maybe it *should* be.  The full title
of the book is *A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction*. Yes,
this is a book about architecture - but not *software* architecture. It is
about the houses and buildings that we walk live and work in.

The description of *A Pattern Language* is one that will sound very familiar
to people familiar with *Design Patterns*:

> It is shown [in *The Timeless Way of Building*], that towns and buildings
will not become alive, unless they are made by all the people in society,
and unless these people share a common pattern language, within which to
make these buildings, and unless this common pattern language is alive itself.
>
> In this book we present one possible pattern language, of the kind called
for in *The Timeless Way*.  This language is extremely practical. It is a
language that we have distilled from our own building and planning efforts
over the last eight years.  You can use it to work with your neighbors, to
improve your town and neighborhood.  You can use it to design a house for
yourself, with your family; or to work with other people to design an office
or a workshop or a public building like a school.  And you can use it to guide
you in the actual process of construction.
>
> The elements of this language are entities called patterns.  Each pattern
describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and
then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that
you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the
same way twice.

This is the book that inspired Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vissides.

By reading *A Pattern Language* you will be able to understand what the
authors of *Design Patterns* were trying to do and how design patterns
were intended to work.

It's a good book too, who knows what else you will find useful in it.
Pattern #146 describes a flexible office space.  Pattern #148 describes a
workspace for small work groups, #151 is about small meeting rooms, #152 is
a half private office.  Everyone who works in today's world of computers
and cubes, can use these ideas to conceptualize and consider improvements to
the office.

# [Programming Pearls](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201657880/)

There are several things in this book that it has going for it.  The essay
"Cracking the Oyster" starts out with a simple question: "How do I sort
a disk file?". This question turns out to be probably the earliest documented
XY problem and the essay works through the *actual* problem that is being
sought. (A reading of this one and seeing someone else go through the process
of trying to figure out the problem should be required text for people who
keep getting their questions closed as 'unclear' on Stack Overflow
and Exchange).

The pearls of wisdom that this book provides - are in easy to digest short
chapters (its original form was that of a column in
[Communications of the ACM](http://www.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs340/spring05/coursestuff/Bentley_BumperSticker.pdf)).
Each chapter stands on its own, as something that you can read quickly,
and take away something new from each time you read it.

Many of the problems, puzzles, and the solution to these puzzles are ones
that interviewers will ask.  Even looking at the process of how to solve the
problems interviewers *don't* ask, can be invaluable.
